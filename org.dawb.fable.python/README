README for Fable.Python 
=======================

Andy Gotz @ esrf.eu
-------------------

The fable.python plugin is a workbench for interactive Python scripting
and plotting inside Fable. It has views to open a Python console with
its own dedicated Python interpreter (via Jep). Python scripts can be 
executed by typing them in or by executing a script in a file. Data
can be plotted using the command plot.1d() (in the future 2d and 3d plotting
will be added). 

The aim of the fable.python workbench is to make it easy to switch between
the graphical user interface and Python. Fable.python could also be used
as a standalone Python workbench.
