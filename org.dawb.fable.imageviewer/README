The Fable Imageviewer program is an Eclipse based program written in Java 
for displaying diffraction images and their metadata i.e. headers. Imageviewer 
has been developed in order to be able to display images in Fable java programs 
but  it can be used as a standalone program too.

Fable imageviewer is based on the fabio Python module for reading files. 
Fabio supports a wide variety of formats e.g. EDF, TIF, Bruker, ADSC,
Mar345, MarCCD, OXD, GE. In order to use fabio to read files you must install 
Python 2.5 and the modules fabio, pil and numeric and (on Linux) set the environment
variable LD_PRELOAD to point to your Python shared object e.g. /usr/lib/libpython2.5.so.1.0.
In the future imageviewer will package these modules for you.

Contributions in the form of ideas, Eclipse plugins, java code and/or python 
modules are welcomed

INSTALL
=======

To install Imageviewer all you need to do is unzip the fable.imageviewer in a
directory of your choice. As mentioned above you need to have Python, numpy and PIL
installed in order for fabio to work. Fable.imageviewer includes these packages
for you. Use the run_imageviewer script for your platform to run imageviewer :

- Linux : run_imageviewer.sh

- Windows : run_imageviewer.bat
